DATA SETS:
Possible data set that we could use found here (might not be enough data tho, we will work it out). Includes genre already, which we can use as training (or test I also forget which is which) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time


from data.world which seems to be a website that collects datasets. They have a bunch of data sets from musems around the world. Haven't looked too much into the datasets themselves but it seems that it could have something cool  https://data.world/datasets/art



THOUGHTS/IDEAS:
If we wanted to do supervised machine learning we could use some of these as topics https://www.pictoclub.com/types-of-painting-art-styles-mediums-subjects/
If not we could just do unsupervised ML. 






REFERENCE FILES ON REPO:
RDay20_PC_STUDENTS_ML2.ipynb :
This file is from PHY 480, contains an example of how we could incorporate image reading (look at question on the file 2.3.1)

Day20_IC_STUDENTS_ML2 (1).ipynb :
More goodies on using ML with image proccesing. from PHY 480 


https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391 :
A scientific research paper on Visual explanations from deep newtorks. Currently not using anything from it but prof might want some bullshit like this. Shows how to use heat maps to get some values for ML. Some cool equations in here as well




MODULES YOU MIGHT NEED: 
Opencv documentation https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/



VERSIONS(might delete later): (update this as we go on just incase there some fucky shit with different versions of python/matplotlib/etc.)
python=3.9.13
