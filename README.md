# Painting Classifier by Style

## Description
This project aims to classify paintings by their style using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project uses a dataset from Kaggle's Painter by Numbers competition, which includes over 100,000 paintings from various styles and periods. By analyzing the visual features of each painting using CNNs, the classifier can predict which style it belongs to with a high degree of accuracy.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this model can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/painter-by-numbers/data

A scientific research paper on Visual explanations from deep newtorks. Currently not using anything from it but prof might want some bullshit like this. Shows how to use heat maps to get some values for ML. Some cool equations in here as well
