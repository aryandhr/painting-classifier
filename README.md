# Painting Classifier by Style

## Description
This project aims to classify paintings by their style using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project uses a dataset from Kaggle's Painter by Numbers competition, which includes over 100,000 paintings from various styles and periods. By analyzing the visual features of each painting using CNNs, the classifier can predict which style it belongs to with a high degree of accuracy.
